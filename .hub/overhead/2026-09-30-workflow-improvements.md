# Small workflow improvements and the next-run measurement

Requested by Brett in chat on 2026-09-30, following the
[B-120 overhead audit](../workpads/B-120.md#workflow-overhead-audit).
This log records the experiment; `queue/` and the live claim refs still own
work-item state. Times below are UTC, including intervals after midnight on
2026-10-01. They are coarse observed working intervals, not a profiler.

## Changes being evaluated

1. `scripts/hub status ID` reads the current queue fields and live claim tip in
   one call. It reports the raw action rather than repeating eligibility logic.
   An unreadable claim is `unknown`, with a failing exit, never `absent`.
2. A successful or idempotent `hub claim` prints the existing work branch,
   workpad location and shell-quoted setup hints. The target member checkout and
   fetched base remain explicit inputs. The client creates no checkout or report.
3. `queue/README.md` has a short operational entrypoint linking to the existing
   authority files. No approval rule, claim protocol or planning store changes.

This is directly authorized maintenance, without allocating a new backlog ID.
These changes affect the ecosystem's operational client, not R package
behaviour; there is no Python package capability to mirror or parity difference
to register. No ontology term is selected or changed.

## Evidence

- The existing local-Git harness gained two checks: status at absent, released,
  handed-off and reclaimed tips (including failed lookup, seven malformed
  records and a resolved dependency retained in the raw queue field), and
  fresh/idempotent setup hints with shell-sensitive checkout paths. Remote
  refs, checkouts and workpads are checked for unintended writes.
- Against the baseline client the two new checks fail. The harness also detects
  a concurrent edit to the checkout under test, as intended.
- With the edited files frozen, `bash scripts/tests/test_hub_claim.sh` passes
  **43 checks, zero failures and zero skips**. `bash -n` on both scripts,
  `git diff --check`, queue validation and the existing OKF capture check pass.
- Live `hub status B-99` reports its queue fields and an absent claim. This is
  a read, not a claim or permission to implement it.
- The independent read found two defects before publication: a raw dependency
  label was showing filtered dependencies, and a fetched but unreadable record
  could report success. Both have regression coverage. A subsequent run caught
  a validation mistake that treated the stored ISO lease as numeric; status
  now uses the client's existing ISO parser.
- `Rscript scripts/build-pkgdown.R` passes using B-120's cached pinned Pandoc
  3.8.3. Only the new NEWS fragment and its search entry are retained. The build
  regenerated unrelated pre-existing pages; those are restored. The rebuilt
  search index changes exactly one entry, the development Internal section.

## Investment and friction observed during this change

| Interval | Activity | Attribution limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 02:53:10–03:00:02 | Recover current state, archive merged B-120 worktree, isolate helpers, investigate expired GitHub authentication | Mixed startup and environment repair; not a hub-bureaucracy percentage |
| 03:00:02–03:03:02 | Implement helpers and short entrypoint | Improvement investment, charged separately from B-99 |
| 03:03:02–03:12:09 | Verify and correct test expectations | Includes two avoidable noisy runs; exact rework duration was not isolated |
| 03:12:09–03:18:09 | Save this audit, build and curate NEWS, independent review and corrections | Mixed documentation, review and implementation investment |
| 03:18:09–03:19:08 | Verification finds the stored-lease validation mistake | Implementation defect, not claim bureaucracy |
| 03:19:08–03:20:31 | Inspect the stored date format and reuse the existing parser | Corrective implementation |
| 03:20:31–03:21:38 | Final frozen harness run | 43 passed; right-sized verification, not waste |

Two concrete avoidable costs occurred: running a test file while another agent
was editing it, and expecting an old fixture's action to remain `claim` after
earlier checks changed it to `reclaim`. Files are now frozen before a suite
starts. This is an execution adjustment, with no additional approval or tracker.

The saved GitHub CLI token was invalid. Public reads and the connected app
worked, but the initial orphan claim commit could not be created through that
app's available Git interface. A device login lets Brett reconnect from his
phone without changing the claim protocol. Credential repair and passive login
waiting are recorded separately from coordination overhead. The first device
code expired without authorization. No claim was created as a workaround.

Reusing the already-pinned Pandoc avoided another download/toolchain repair.
Site generation still changes unrelated pages even with matching versions.
A possible later small improvement is a NEWS-only build route for a NEWS-only
change, with the corresponding build guidance updated once. It is a candidate,
not an added policy or a claim of measured savings.

## Measurement rules for B-99, fixed before starting it

- Time claim and member-checkout setup from the first pickup command to the
  prepared worktree. Exclude authentication repair and passive waiting.
- Record implementation, verification, coordination/publication, environment
  repair and production of this requested audit separately. A mixed interval
  stays mixed; it does not become an invented percentage.
- Count repeated manual lookups, reruns caused by coordination, requests for
  approval, and external waits. Distinguish required checks from rework.
- Compare the pickup interval with B-120's identifiable **2m14s** setup interval.
  Different repositories and task scopes limit the comparison. One run cannot
  establish a causal whole-task improvement or amortize helper development.
- Report an avoidable share only when a recorded interval supports it. The
  B-120 audit's original 35–45% administration and 20–30% avoidable estimates
  were withdrawn; they are not the baseline.

## Next run

B-99 was the oldest eligible P2 candidate in the live queue inspection. After
Brett completed a fresh device login on his computer, the existing client
claimed it successfully, without an alternative lock mechanism.

The member checkout was fetched and fast-forwarded before the pickup timer.
From **04:10:23 to 04:11:21 UTC on 2026-10-01**, `hub status`, `hub claim` and the
two printed setup commands prepared its worktree in **58s**. B-120's recorded
pickup was 2m14s: an observed 1m16s (57%) shorter interval, with preparation,
repository and scope differences that prevent assigning the change to the
helpers alone. It is not a measured whole-task bureaucracy or avoidable share.

B-99's new tests reproduced both original 404s. After the three-cell CSV fix,
the full suite passes **54 tests and 22 subtests, zero skips**, including live
Turtle subject/type checks. Generated artifacts remain synchronized. The
item's implementation, source justification, skip retirement and timings live
in `smn-data-pkg`'s `.hub/workpads/B-99.md`. No file-edit race or coordination
rerun occurred during its RED/GREEN verification.

## Adjustment after B-99

`status` initially omitted `evidence` and `retires_when`, so the pickup still
needed a separate queue-file read. The next iteration prints those canonical
fields using the existing extractor and checks the added output in the same
harness. The frozen harness still passes **43 checks, no failures or skips**.
This is two added fields, not another planner or a new claim protocol.

The next cycle claimed B-186, a queued stream-validation defect. From
**04:24:16 to 04:25:20 UTC, 64s**, the same status/claim/setup sequence prepared
the worktree. This includes a brief inspection of the Claude review workflow;
the interval is not a pure setup benchmark. The evidence and retirement
condition were available in status, so no separate queue-file read was needed.
Its implementation agent reports 164 passing Python tests after a focused RED,
with lint passing on all 318 queue items. Root review and publication follow.

Brett subsequently asked for ongoing iterations, parallel claims once the
process settles, and Claude review rounds until substantive findings are
resolved. Brett then approved the complete helper and B-99 PR texts and
explicitly authorized routine branch publication and draft PR creation for
this continuous run without repeated approval questions; review-fix commits
were already authorized. This is a chat authorization for this run, not an
amendment to AGENTS or HUB policy. Semantic and policy decisions remain his;
merge, release and person-contact authority was not added. The experiment does
not treat authorization or an unstarted review as a successful publication or
review outcome.


## Parallel round and NEWS build adjustment

- B-268 and B-132 published as draft pull requests 216 and 217. Each agent
  owns its claim, worktree, focused verification, publication and handoff.
  Root's extra publication hold delayed B-132 after its tested local commit;
  it is removed for routine drafts under Brett's standing approval. No new
  tracker or approval boundary is introduced.
- B-155's pak-bootstrap failure proofs pass; B-133 is the next independent
  vignette fix. B-186's stream-lint regression has 164 passing offline tests.
  These are observed local results, not merged work or completed remote reviews.
- The NEWS-only build completed with the existing pinned toolchain. Before
  curation it touched three tracked paths (NEWS HTML, its Markdown companion and search), versus about
  forty tracked pages and four new reference pages in B-268's full build.
  It still renders the whole NEWS page, so pre-existing source/site drift must
  be reviewed and unrelated fragments restored. This reduces output scope;
  build duration and total overhead savings were not isolated.
- Claude jobs on helper PR 215 finished green but produced no review comments.
  Logs report two denied tool calls on the draft and three after ready-for-review.
  The denied calls are hidden and no execution artifact was retained. Review
  completion is therefore unverified. Local Claude is logged out; Brett was
  asked to reconnect while implementation continues.

Current useful balance: one claim per real agent, isolated worktrees, one
focused regression per defect, and autonomous routine draft publication.
Further redesign is deferred until a concrete recurring cost warrants it.
The requested measurement itself remains a separate activity, not attributed
wholesale to hub bureaucracy.


### Review repair and build checks

Codex review on PR 215 found that a handoff with no required branch could
report success. A frozen harness run reproduced it (42 passing checks, one
failure); status now requires the exact `agent/<id>/<agent>` branch for a
handoff. Other actions may legitimately omit it. The invalid-branch fixture
explicitly writes an arbitrary branch, as well as testing a missing branch.

NEWS-only rejects an unknown flag, rejects combining a partial build with a
toolchain upgrade, and rejects the unpinned local Pandoc. A pinned build passes.
Inspection found that `build_news()` alone omits its Markdown companion, so
the route now uses pkgdown's existing converter for NEWS alone. B-186 exercised
the route from a different task checkout without copying the helper script.

B-133's actual Claude comment on head 1d48520 reports no issues found. Other
draft jobs remain skips or unverified, not successful reviews. B-155's first
workflow failed with zero jobs and was absent from PR checks; actionlint
reproduced an invalid runner context and verified the pushed correction.
This is implementation rework, rather than claim administration.

The handoff repair's frozen GREEN run passes all 43 checks, zero failures or
skips. During B-186 handoff, root edited the client while Bash was still
reading it: the claim handoff succeeded, followed by a stray parse/read error.
An idempotent repeat confirmed handoff. Freeze the client during live commands
as well as harness runs; this was an avoidable coordination race.


## Sustained parallel round, observed through 05:59 UTC on 2026-10-01

The useful balance is now in use: each real agent selects an independent
eligible item, runs its evidence-driven checks, publishes under the standing
chat approval and hands it off. Root does not approve these routine steps
again. Claims and handoffs remain in the existing client; merge decisions
remain with Brett. This has kept three implementation agents working while
root fixes the review instrument and completes separate claims.

### Concrete results of the small changes

| Observation | Evidence and limits |
| --- | --- |
| B-203 reuses the NEWS-only route | 22.5s; generated output scope is three tracked paths. Claim-to-publication was about14m19s, including policy review, experiments and documentation, so that interval is not a waste estimate. |
| B-177 reuses the route | NEWS16s plus search9.5s; baseline/RED/GREEN tests11.8/7.4/8s. Claim-to-publication about11m48s. Different task scopes prevent a causal before/after percentage. |
| B-133 uses focused verification | About11m40s claim-to-ready; approximately5m10s was verification and1m publication. The complete CI and actual Claude review passed. |
| Routine publication is autonomous | Agents published B-203, B-256, B-371, B-177, B-229, B-23, B-262, B-264 and B-310 without an extra root/user permission round. |
| Source/site drift still consumes effort | B-269 final inspection caught a duplicated older news fragment. It was removed; only the new NEWS and reader search entries changed. This manual curation is the next improvement candidate. |
| Root interleaves work | B-269's claim began05:19:17, but review-workflow repair occupied the same interval. Elapsed claim duration is not a task-only or administrative duration. |

### Review evidence and repair

Claude has actually commented “No issues found” on helper PR215 at3adde91 and
vignette PR220 at1d48520. A green job without a posted review is not counted.
Draft PR jobs skip, and the plugin also skips already-commented PRs, so it
cannot supply the iterative review requested. PR222 replaces those skips with
a scoped per-head review and checks successful read/diff/comment tool results,
a successful SDK result, no denials and the exact reviewed-head marker.

The Anthropic action refuses a changed workflow before it reaches the default
branch. The repair therefore needs one explicit bootstrap merge decision;
its five other CI checks pass at051dd05. This is a concrete approval boundary,
not another routine publication question. Local Claude is still logged out.
A separate B-229 Claude job failed after375ms with no model usage, so it also
provides no review. No claim is described as Claude-reviewed on those signals.

Codex found a real public-wrapper candidate-limit defect in Python PR80.
The agent reproduced3 versus6 candidates, fixed the wrapper and verified28
focused tests in both environments; repair head dd8a5b0 has all three workflows
green. Root's independent B-269 read agrees with the enum change; a truncated
source read incorrectly reported a missing similarity field, and a direct read
of the pinned schema confirmed its string range. Review findings need evidence.

### Next adjustment

A dedicated NEWS source/site reconciliation could remove repeated manual
fragment restoration. Keep it separate from defect branches and measure its
next use before adding automation. More workflow design is deferred while
independent claims can proceed. Requested measurement, environment repair,
verification, implementation rework and avoidable coordination remain separate;
there is still no defensible whole-run “percent wasted” measurement.


## Harness isolation adjustment and shared handoff compatibility

B-338 defines a chat handoff for shared repositories with no branch field and
exact `reason: hand-back in chat`. The status helper now recognizes that shape
and prints its reason. Missing/wrong reason, an explicitly empty branch and an
arbitrary branch remain unknown; ordinary branch handoffs keep their exact
branch check. Status reads the record; it does not grant either publication mode.

The compatibility fixture reproduced the expected status failure. A separate
repository-fingerprint failure was caused by another worktree creating a branch
during the harness, although the tested source files stayed frozen. B-338's
agent hit the same condition during independent verification. This is avoidable
coordination rework: freezing files alone cannot freeze a shared Git common-dir.

The small execution fix is a local frozen clone with separate Git refs, copied
working client/harness bytes and a local snapshot commit. Run the existing
harness there, then compare the tested source bytes with the working files.
No guard is weakened and other agents keep working. In that isolated clone,
all **43 checks pass, zero failures/skips**, and byte comparisons match.
B-338 is evaluating the same procedure in its next verification round.

B-394 was published as [PR234](https://github.com/salmon-data-mobilization/metasalmon/pull/234)
after its RED and all 163 offline queue tests passed. Its broader read exposed
seven absent recognizable historical port records; live merged PR evidence
justifies the amendments. Independent inspection found no actionable bug.
B-265, B-401 and B-129 are published as [233](https://github.com/salmon-data-mobilization/metasalmon/pull/233),
[235](https://github.com/salmon-data-mobilization/metasalmon/pull/235) and
[236](https://github.com/salmon-data-mobilization/metasalmon/pull/236).

Two scoped build ideas remain candidates: reconcile NEWS source/site history,
and preserve existing site assets during article/index builds. They are not
implemented as another workflow layer during ongoing claims.
