# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines technical terms used throughout the metasalmon
documentation in plain English. You don’t need to memorize these - refer
back here whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term.

## Core Concepts

### Data Package

A folder containing your data files plus metadata CSVs that explain
what’s in them. Tools also generate a `datapackage.json` Frictionless
profile descriptor by default for publication-ready packages.

**Example**: A folder containing: - `data/escapement.csv` (your data) -
`metadata/dataset.csv` and `metadata/tables.csv` (dataset and table
metadata) - `metadata/column_dictionary.csv` (column descriptions) -
`datapackage.json` (generated Frictionless profile descriptor for
publication-ready packages)

### Data Dictionary

A table that describes each column in your data - what it means, what
type of values it contains, and what units it uses.

**Example**:

| Column   | Description                  | Type    |
|----------|------------------------------|---------|
| POP_ID   | Unique population identifier | text    |
| SPAWNERS | Estimated spawner count      | number  |
| YEAR     | Survey year                  | integer |

### Column Role

A category that describes what kind of information a column contains.
metasalmon uses these roles:

| Role            | What it means                | Examples                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **identifier**  | Uniquely identifies a record | POP_ID, SITE_CODE          |
| **attribute**   | Describes a characteristic   | STREAM_NAME, SPECIES       |
| **measurement** | A numeric observation        | SPAWNER_COUNT, TEMPERATURE |
| **temporal**    | A date or time               | SURVEY_DATE, YEAR          |
| **categorical** | A code from a fixed list     | RUN_TYPE, QUALITY_FLAG     |

### Code List

A table that explains what each code value means for categorical
columns.

**Example** for a SPECIES column:

| Code | Label          |
|------|----------------|
| CO   | Coho Salmon    |
| CH   | Chinook Salmon |
| PK   | Pink Salmon    |
| SO   | Sockeye Salmon |

## Semantic Web Terms

These terms relate to linking your data to standard scientific
definitions. **You don’t need to understand these to use metasalmon** -
they’re handled automatically. This section is for those who want to
understand what’s happening behind the scenes.

### IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier)

A web address (like a URL) that points to an official definition of a
term. When we say “spawner count” means the same thing across all DFO
datasets, we prove it by pointing to a shared IRI.

**Example**: `https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#NaturalSpawnerCount`

Think of it like a library catalog number - it uniquely identifies a
specific concept so there’s no confusion.

### Ontology

A shared vocabulary where scientists agree on what terms mean - like a
specialized dictionary for salmon science. An ontology defines not just
terms, but also how they relate to each other.

**Example**: The DFO Salmon Ontology defines terms like “Conservation
Unit”, “Escapement”, and “Run Timing”, and explains how they relate
(e.g., a Conservation Unit contains multiple Populations).

### SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)

A system for organizing vocabulary terms into lists. Used for: - Code
lists (all valid species codes) - Measurement definitions (what
“escapement” means) - Vocabulary schemes (all run timing categories)

**Plain English**: Think of SKOS as a way to create organized lists with
definitions.

### OWL (Web Ontology Language)

A system for defining categories of things and their relationships. Used
for: - Defining what a “Conservation Unit” is - Saying that “Coho” is a
type of “Pacific Salmon” - Describing that a “Population” belongs to a
“Conservation Unit”

**Plain English**: Think of OWL as a classification system, like how
biology classifies species into genus, family, order, etc.

### Semantic

“Meaning-aware” - data that carries its definitions with it so computers
and humans can understand it the same way.

**Non-semantic data**: A column called `SPAWN_EST` with no explanation
**Semantic data**: The same column linked to a definition that says
“Estimated count of naturally spawning adults”

## I-ADOPT Framework

I-ADOPT (InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology)
is a framework for precisely describing what a measurement represents.
It answers the question: “What exactly did you measure?”

### The Core Components

I-ADOPT defines observable properties using four components:

| Component | Question it answers | Example |
|----|----|----|
| **Variable** | What compound concept? | “Sea surface temperature” (the full term) |
| **Property** | What characteristic? | Temperature |
| **Entity** | Of what thing? | Sea surface (water at ocean surface) |
| **Constraint** | Any qualifiers or limits? | Maximum, daily average, etc. |

**Why this matters**: Two researchers might both measure “temperature”
but mean different things (air vs. water, surface vs. depth). I-ADOPT
removes ambiguity by requiring you to specify exactly what property of
what entity you measured.

### Understanding the Components

- **Variable**: The complete, compound term that describes what you
  measured (e.g., “Natural spawner count”). In metasalmon, this maps to
  `term_iri`.
- **Property**: The measurable characteristic (e.g., “count”,
  “temperature”, “length”). Maps to `property_iri`.
- **Entity**: The thing being measured (e.g., “spawning salmon”, “stream
  water”). Maps to `entity_iri`.
- **Constraint**: Optional qualifiers that narrow the scope (e.g.,
  “maximum”, “annual”, “wild-origin only”). Maps to `constraint_iri`.

### Units (Not Part of I-ADOPT Core)

While I-ADOPT focuses on describing *what* you measured, you’ll also
need to record the **units** (how the measurement is expressed).
metasalmon includes `unit_iri` for this purpose, typically linking to
vocabularies like QUDT.

**Note**: Method (how the measurement was made) is important metadata
but is not part of the I-ADOPT framework itself. You can document
methods in your column descriptions or other metadata fields.

## Frictionless Data

A standard format for data packages that works across different software
and programming languages. metasalmon creates Frictionless-compatible
packages, which means:

- Your packages work with Python, R, JavaScript, and other tools
- Other researchers can open your packages without installing metasalmon
- The format follows an international standard (not a DFO-specific
  format)

## Still Confused?

That’s okay! The most important terms for getting started are:

1.  **Data Package** - what you’re creating
2.  **Data Dictionary** - what describes your columns
3.  **Code List** - what explains your categorical codes

Everything else is handled automatically by metasalmon. You can create
excellent, shareable data packages without understanding IRIs, SKOS,
OWL, or I-ADOPT.
