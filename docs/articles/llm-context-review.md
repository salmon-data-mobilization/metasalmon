# LLM Review With Context Files

Use this guide when you want
[`create_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/create_sdp.md)
or
[`suggest_semantics()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/suggest_semantics.md)
to review semantic candidates with an LLM **and** you have supporting
files such as README notes, data dictionaries, or technical reports.

## What Context Files Are Supported

`llm_context_files` accepts local files that can add domain context to
the LLM review step:

- markdown/text notes: `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`
- delimited/text data: `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`
- source/notebook files: `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`
- HTML pages: `.htm`, `.html`
- Word documents: `.docx`
- PDF reports: `.pdf` with the optional `pdftools` package
- Excel workbooks: `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` with the optional `readxl`
  package

The files are read locally, chunked, and trimmed before prompting. They
are used as supporting evidence only. The LLM still has to choose from
the deterministic shortlist returned by
[`find_terms()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/find_terms.md);
it does not mint raw IRIs.

## Recommended Context Bundle

For a realistic Salmon Data Package review, pass a small bundle that
mixes:

1.  a README, HTML export, or methods note describing the dataset,
2.  a CSV, workbook, or DOCX/R Markdown data dictionary or analyst note,
3.  a technical report or PDF summary if one exists.

For example:

``` r

context_files <- c(
  "README.md",
  "methods-note.Rmd",
  "data-dictionary.xlsx",
  "technical-report.pdf"
)
```

## One-shot `create_sdp()` Workflow

For DFO internal users, `chapi` plus the default Mistral model is the
shortest path:

``` r

library(metasalmon)

data_path <- system.file("extdata", "nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024.csv", package = "metasalmon")
fraser_coho <- readr::read_csv(data_path, show_col_types = FALSE)

pkg_path <- create_sdp(
  fraser_coho,
  path = "fraser-coho-2023-2024-sdp",
  dataset_id = "fraser-coho-2023-2024",
  table_id = "escapement",
  llm_assess = TRUE,
  llm_provider = "chapi",
  llm_model = "ollama2.mistral:7b",
  llm_context_files = context_files,
  check_updates = FALSE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

That writes a review-ready package and uses the LLM to judge
deterministic candidates during semantic seeding.

What gets written back automatically:

- accepted column-level drafts into `metadata/column_dictionary.csv` as
  `REVIEW: <iri>`
- accepted table observation-unit drafts into `metadata/tables.csv` as
  `REVIEW: <iri>` when the suggestion is still lexically compatible with
  the table metadata

What stays in `semantic_suggestions.csv` for manual review:

- dataset-level keyword suggestions targeting `metadata/dataset.csv`
- code-level semantic suggestions targeting `metadata/codes.csv`
- any additional shortlist evidence and `llm_*` review columns

## Full Metadata Review With `suggest_semantics()`

If you want to inspect every metadata target explicitly, start from
inferred package artifacts and pass `codes`, `table_meta`, and
`dataset_meta` back into
[`suggest_semantics()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/suggest_semantics.md):

``` r

artifacts <- infer_salmon_datapackage_artifacts(
  resources = list(escapement = fraser_coho),
  dataset_id = "fraser-coho-2023-2024",
  table_id = "escapement",
  seed_semantics = FALSE
)

reviewed_dict <- suggest_semantics(
  df = artifacts$resources,
  dict = artifacts$dict,
  codes = artifacts$codes,
  table_meta = artifacts$table_meta,
  dataset_meta = artifacts$dataset_meta,
  llm_assess = TRUE,
  llm_provider = "chapi",
  llm_model = "ollama2.mistral:7b",
  llm_context_files = context_files
)

suggestions <- attr(reviewed_dict, "semantic_suggestions")
assessments <- attr(reviewed_dict, "semantic_llm_assessments")
```

Now you can filter by target file:

``` r

suggestions[, c("target_sdp_file", "target_sdp_field", "table_id", "column_name", "code_value", "label", "iri", "llm_decision", "llm_selected")]
```

Look especially at:

- `target_sdp_file == "column_dictionary.csv"`
- `target_sdp_file == "codes.csv"`
- `target_sdp_file == "tables.csv"`
- `target_sdp_file == "dataset.csv"`

That is the clearest path when you want the LLM to help review semantics
across **all** package metadata tables before you finalize anything.

## Review Order

After
[`create_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/create_sdp.md)
or
[`suggest_semantics()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/suggest_semantics.md):

1.  open `README-review.txt`,
2.  review `metadata/column_dictionary.csv`,
3.  review `metadata/tables.csv`,
4.  review `metadata/dataset.csv`,
5.  review `metadata/codes.csv` when present,
6.  use `semantic_suggestions.csv` as the fallback evidence table.

Keep or edit every `REVIEW:` draft in the metadata CSVs directly. The
`semantic_suggestions.csv` file is evidence, not the canonical package
state.

## Rebuild EDH XML After Review

Once the package metadata is finalized:

``` r

validate_salmon_datapackage(pkg_path, require_iris = TRUE)
write_edh_xml_from_sdp(pkg_path)
```

[`write_edh_xml_from_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/write_edh_xml_from_sdp.md)
is intentionally strict. It refuses to rebuild from packages that still
contain `REVIEW:` markers or unresolved dataset/table placeholders. That
means the expected path is:

1.  create the package,
2.  review and finalize the metadata CSVs,
3.  remove all `REVIEW:` prefixes,
4.  run strict validation,
5.  rebuild the EDH XML.
