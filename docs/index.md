## The Problem

You’ve spent years collecting salmon data. But when you try to share it:

- Colleagues ask “What does SPAWN_EST mean?”
- Combining datasets fails because everyone uses different column names
- Your future self opens old data and can’t remember what the codes mean
- Other researchers can’t use your data without emailing you for
  explanations

## The Solution

`metasalmon` wraps your salmon data with a **data dictionary** that
travels with it—explaining every column, every code, and linking to
standard scientific definitions. These definitions come from the [Salmon
Domain Ontology](https://w3id.org/smn/) (shared layer) and the [DFO
Salmon Ontology](https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon/) (DFO-specific layer),
alongside other published controlled vocabularies, and the data is
packaged according to the [Salmon Data Package
Specification](https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/smn-data-pkg/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.md).
The preferred review workflow now happens **inside the R package**:
`metasalmon` can retrieve candidate terms, optionally ask an LLM to
review them, write draft REVIEW-prefixed IRIs into the package metadata,
and then send you back to the created package so you can confirm or edit
those values directly in Excel.

**Integration context:** See the Salmon Data Integration System overview
page (<https://br-johnson.github.io/salmon-data-integration-system/>)
and walkthrough video
(<https://youtu.be/B0Zqac49zng?si=VmOjbfMDMd2xW9fH>).

**Think of it like adding a detailed legend to your spreadsheet that
never gets lost.**

## Quick Example

Before you start, do the one-time [Setup and
Credentials](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/articles/setup.html)
check so GitHub installs work cleanly and any optional LLM provider is
ready in advance.

Install, run one function on the bundled Fraser Coho 2023-2024 example
(173 rows), then review in Excel.

``` r

# Install from GitHub (recommended)
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("dfo-pacific-science/metasalmon")

library(metasalmon)

data_path <- system.file("extdata", "nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024.csv", package = "metasalmon")
fraser_coho <- readr::read_csv(data_path, show_col_types = FALSE)

pkg_path <- create_sdp(
  fraser_coho,
  path = "fraser-coho-2023-2024-sdp",
  dataset_id = "fraser-coho-2023-2024",
  table_id = "escapement",
  check_updates = FALSE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)

# Open pkg_path and review:
# - metadata/dataset.csv
# - metadata/tables.csv
# - metadata/column_dictionary.csv
# - metadata/codes.csv (if present)
# - data/*.csv
# - semantic_suggestions.csv (if present)
# - README-review.txt
```

[`create_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/create_sdp.md)
is the main path. It writes the canonical `metadata/*.csv` files plus
your `data/*.csv` tables, adds a short review checklist, writes
prefilled semantic drafts directly into `metadata/column_dictionary.csv`
and `metadata/tables.csv` only where target fields were blank, and keeps
`semantic_suggestions.csv` as a fallback shortlist when you want more
context or a better match. Code-level semantic seeding stays
conservative by default for factor and low-cardinality character source
columns. Before SPSR/EDH upload, run
`validate_salmon_datapackage(pkg_path, require_iris = TRUE)` to catch
package/data/codes mismatches in one pass. In interactive use
[`create_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/create_sdp.md)
can also mention an available package update; set
`check_updates = FALSE` to skip that check.

## Bundled NuSEDS Example

The default quickstart and get-started flow use
`nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024.csv`, a 173-row Fraser coho slice derived
from the official Open Government Canada Fraser and BC Interior
workbook.

Open Government Canada record:
<https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6>

A smaller `nuseds-fraser-coho-sample.csv` file is still bundled for tiny
smoke tests, but it is no longer the default walkthrough dataset.

The package also now ships a matching starter dictionary for the fuller
example
(`system.file("extdata", "nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024-column_dictionary.csv", package = "metasalmon")`),
which is useful when you want a ready-made context file for the
package-native LLM review path.

See `example-data-README.md` for the record/resource URLs, row counts,
licensing note, and the `data-raw/` script that reproduces the 2023-2024
example.

Files](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/articles/llm-context-review.html).

## Package-native LLM semantic review (optional)

If you want an LLM to judge the shortlisted semantic matches directly
from R, keep the deterministic search path and add an opt-in review
pass:

``` r

context_files <- c(
  file.path(pkg_path, "metadata", "column_dictionary.csv"),
  "README.md",
  "data-dictionary.xlsx",
  "methods-report.pdf"
)

suggested <- suggest_semantics(
  df = fraser_coho,
  dict = infer_dictionary(fraser_coho, dataset_id = "fraser-coho-2023-2024", table_id = "escapement"),
  llm_assess = TRUE,
  llm_provider = "openrouter",
  llm_context_files = context_files
)

suggestions <- attr(suggested, "semantic_suggestions")
assessments <- attr(suggested, "semantic_llm_assessments")

# In create_sdp(...), any auto-applied semantic IRI drafts are written back
# into the package metadata as REVIEW-prefixed values for manual cleanup,
# including table-level observation-unit selections in metadata/tables.csv.
```

This keeps
[`find_terms()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/find_terms.md)
as the canonical candidate generator. Deterministic auto-applied
semantic drafts are also written back as `REVIEW: <iri>` so you can
confirm or replace them in Excel rather than treating them as final.
When you enable the LLM pass, it judges the retrieved shortlist using
the same review-first convention, including table-level observation-unit
matches written into `metadata/tables.csv`. `llm_context_files` supports
text and notes (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`), delimited/data files (`.csv`,
`.tsv`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`), source and notebook-style files
(`.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`), HTML (`.htm`, `.html`), DOCX (`.docx`), Excel
workbooks (`.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm` via `readxl`), and PDF reports
(`.pdf` via `pdftools`). Validation should only pass after the REVIEW
prefix is removed. When you use `llm_provider = "openrouter"` without
specifying `llm_model`, `metasalmon` now defaults to `openrouter/free`.

For the full workflow across `dataset.csv`, `tables.csv`,
`column_dictionary.csv`, `codes.csv`, and the post-review EDH rebuild,
use the [LLM Review With Context
Files](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/articles/llm-context-review.html)
guide.

The quickstart path does not require an API key. Only set up one of
these providers when you want `create_sdp(..., llm_assess = TRUE)` or
`suggest_semantics(..., llm_assess = TRUE)`.

For DFO internal users on the internal network or VPN, open
<https://chapi-dev.intra.azure.cloud.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/>, click the user
icon in the bottom left, open **Settings**, click **Show** next to **API
Keys**, and copy the key value. Then run:

``` r

file.edit("~/.Renviron")
CHAPI_API_KEY="paste key here"
```

`chapi` defaults to `ollama2.mistral:7b` and
`https://chapi-dev.intra.azure.cloud.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/api`. Optional
overrides are `CHAPI_MODEL` and `CHAPI_BASE_URL`. `gpt-oss:latest` is
also supported, but it can be slower to warm up and now gets a longer
automatic timeout.

For external users, OpenRouter is the easiest free option:

``` r

file.edit("~/.Renviron")
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="paste key here"
```

`llm_provider = "openrouter"` defaults to `openrouter/free`.

If you already have OpenAI API credits, use:

``` r

file.edit("~/.Renviron")
OPENAI_API_KEY="paste key here"
```

Then pass an OpenAI model explicitly, for example
`llm_model = "gpt-4.1-mini"`.

## Recommended workflow

For the current package-native review path, use this order:

1.  Run `create_sdp(...)` to create the Salmon Data Package.
2.  If you want semantic review, set `llm_assess = TRUE`.
3.  Open `README-review.txt`, then review
    `metadata/column_dictionary.csv` and `metadata/tables.csv` first.
    Those files already contain the prefilled semantic values you are
    actually finalizing.
4.  For any prefilled or `REVIEW:`-prefixed IRI, click through and read
    the term definition before keeping it.
5.  Use `semantic_suggestions.csv` only as a fallback shortlist if you
    are unsure or want a better match.
6.  If no candidate fits, request a new term instead of forcing a bad
    match:
    - shared cross-organization/domain terms -\>
      <https://github.com/salmon-data-mobilization/salmon-domain-ontology/issues/new/choose>
    - DFO-specific policy/operations terms -\>
      <https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/dfo-salmon-ontology/issues/new/choose>
7.  Follow the [After Excel
    Review](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/articles/post-review-package-publication.html)
    guide to reload the package, detect unresolved semantic gaps, and
    produce a concrete shared-vs-DFO term-request plan.
8.  If you are preparing EDH metadata, regenerate the XML from the
    reviewed package with `write_edh_xml_from_sdp(pkg_path)` (the
    reviewed-package wrapper around the canonical
    [`edh_build_hnap_xml()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/edh_build_hnap_xml.md)
    builder). It now refuses to rebuild while `REVIEW:` markers or
    unresolved dataset/table placeholder text remain.
9.  Re-run validation with
    `validate_salmon_datapackage(pkg_path, require_iris = TRUE)`.
10. Publish/share only after the `REVIEW:` markers are gone and
    validation passes; send the whole package folder (or a zip of it),
    not individual files.

In other words: **create -\> review in Excel -\> reload/check gaps -\>
remove `REVIEW:` markers -\> rebuild EDH XML if needed -\> validate -\>
publish**.

```

## What’s In a Data Package?

When you create a package, you get a folder containing:

    my-data-package/
      +-- README-review.txt         # Step-by-step review checklist for manual Excel cleanup
      +-- semantic_suggestions.csv  # Detailed semantic evidence + LLM review trail (when present)
      +-- datapackage.json          # Machine-readable export
      +-- metadata/
      |   +-- dataset.csv           # Dataset-level metadata (canonical)
      |   +-- tables.csv            # Table-level metadata and file paths
      |   +-- column_dictionary.csv # What each column means
      |   +-- codes.csv             # What each code value means (if applicable)
      +-- data/
          +-- escapement.csv        # Your data table(s)

Anyone opening this folder - whether a colleague, a reviewer, or your
future self - can immediately understand your data. The `metadata/*.csv`
files are the canonical package metadata; `datapackage.json` is a
derived interoperability export. When you share the package, send the
whole folder (or a zip of the whole folder), not just
`datapackage.json`.

## Key Features

**For everyday use:**

- Automatically generate data dictionaries from your data frames
- Validate that your dictionary is complete and correct
- Create shareable packages that work across R, Python, and other tools
- Read CSVs directly from private GitHub repositories

**For data stewards (optional):**

- Link columns to standard DFO Salmon Ontology terms
- Add I-ADOPT measurement metadata (property, entity, unit, constraint)
- Use AI assistance to help write descriptions
- Suggest Darwin Core Data Package table/field mappings for biodiversity
  data
- Opt in to DwC-DP export hints via
  `suggest_semantics(..., include_dwc = TRUE)` while keeping the Salmon
  Data Package as the canonical deliverable.
- Generate HNAP-aware EDH metadata XML for DFO Enterprise Data Hub
  upload workflows via the canonical
  [`edh_build_hnap_xml()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/edh_build_hnap_xml.md)
  builder, the reviewed-package helper
  [`write_edh_xml_from_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/write_edh_xml_from_sdp.md),
  or `create_sdp(..., include_edh_xml = TRUE)`.
- Role-aware vocabulary search with
  [`find_terms()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/find_terms.md)
  and
  [`sources_for_role()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/sources_for_role.md):
  - Units: QUDT preferred, then NVS P06
  - Salmon-domain roles: shared SMN terms first, then GCDFO DFO-specific
    terms where needed
  - Entities/taxa: SMN and GCDFO first, then GBIF and WoRMS taxon
    resolvers
  - Properties/variables/methods: shared salmon-domain terms first, then
    broader ontology fallbacks
  - Cross-source agreement boosting for high-confidence matches
- Per-source diagnostics, scoring, and optional rerank explain why
  [`find_terms()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/find_terms.md)
  matches rank where they do and expose failures, so you can tune
  role-aware queries with confidence.
- End-to-end semantic QA loop with
  [`fetch_salmon_ontology()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/fetch_salmon_ontology.md) +
  [`validate_semantics()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/validate_semantics.md),
  plus
  [`deduplicate_proposed_terms()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/deduplicate_proposed_terms.md)
  to prevent term proliferation before opening ontology issues.
- Optional package-native LLM review for semantic suggestions:
  `suggest_semantics(..., llm_assess = TRUE)` can judge retrieved
  candidates directly in R, include local README/report context files,
  and use OpenAI-compatible providers such as OpenRouter (including
  model ids ending in `:free`).
- NuSEDS method crosswalk helpers:
  [`nuseds_enumeration_method_crosswalk()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/nuseds_enumeration_method_crosswalk.md)
  and
  [`nuseds_estimate_method_crosswalk()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/nuseds_estimate_method_crosswalk.md)
  for mapping legacy values to canonical method families.

## How It Fits Together

`metasalmon` brings together four pieces: your raw data, the Salmon Data
Package specification, the Salmon Domain Ontology (and other
vocabularies), optional in-package LLM review, and the review files
written into the package itself. When you finish the workflow, the
dictionary, dataset/table metadata, and optional code lists are already
aligned with the specification, which makes the package ready to
publish. The ontology keeps the column meanings consistent, and the
package-native review workflow helps draft descriptions and term choices
without forcing you into a separate prompt-export side path.

The high-level flow is:

- **Start here:**
  [`create_sdp()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/create_sdp.md)
  takes raw tables, infers the package metadata, writes a review-ready
  package, gives you a checklist, auto-fills top column/table semantic
  suggestions only where fields are blank, and keeps default code-level
  semantic seeding conservative by limiting it to factor and
  low-cardinality character source columns.
- **Advanced/manual path:**
  [`write_salmon_datapackage()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/write_salmon_datapackage.md)
  is for cases where you already assembled `dataset.csv`, `tables.csv`,
  `column_dictionary.csv`, and optional `codes.csv` yourself.
- **Raw tables** lead into `metadata/column_dictionary.csv` (and
  `metadata/codes.csv` when there are categorical columns).
- **Dataset/table metadata** fill the required specification fields
  (title, description, creator, contact, etc.), so the package folder
  can be shared or uploaded.
- **The Salmon Domain Ontology and published vocabularies** supply
  `term_iri`/`entity_iri` links that describe what each column and row
  represents.
- **Post-review publication helpers** let you reopen the package, re-run
  semantic checks, detect unresolved ontology gaps, and separate shared
  SMN requests from DFO/program-specific follow-up.
- **[`write_salmon_datapackage()`](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/reference/write_salmon_datapackage.md)**
  consumes the metadata, dictionary, codes, and data to write the files
  in the Salmon Data Package format; the preferred review loop is now
  the package itself plus `README-review.txt` /
  `semantic_suggestions.csv`, not an external prompt-export workflow.

### Salmon Domain Ontology

This package can link your data to the [Salmon Domain
Ontology](https://w3id.org/smn/) for shared terms and to the [DFO Salmon
Ontology](https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon/) for DFO-specific terms.
Canonical IRIs are explicit: SMN uses `https://w3id.org/smn/<Term>` and
GCDFO uses `https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#<Term>`. metasalmon does not
silently rewrite legacy `salmon:` IRIs.

See the [Reusing Standards for Salmon Data
Terms](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/metasalmon/articles/reusing-standards-salmon-data-terms.html)
guide for details.
