# Built-in NuSEDS example data

`metasalmon` ships two Fraser coho example tables so users can choose a tiny demo
or a fuller official slice.

## Included files

| File | Rows | Years | Intended use |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `nuseds-fraser-coho-sample.csv` | 30 | 1996–2024 | Smallest possible walkthroughs, fast examples, light semantic seeding demos |
| `nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024.csv` | 173 | 2023–2024 | More realistic package creation, testing, and documentation examples |

The tiny sample is retained unchanged for backwards compatibility.

## Provenance for the fuller official example

## Reproducible derivation

The source repository includes `data-raw/nuseds_fraser_coho_examples.R`, which
recreates `nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024.csv` by:

1. downloading the official Fraser and BC Interior workbook,
2. filtering to `SPECIES == "Coho"`,
3. filtering to `ANALYSIS_YR %in% c(2023, 2024)`,
4. keeping a compact analysis-friendly subset of columns,
5. using `NATURAL_ADULT_SPAWNERS` because `NATURAL_SPAWNERS_TOTAL` is blank for
   this official two-year slice,
6. converting `START_DTT` and `END_DTT` to ISO dates, and
7. sorting by `ANALYSIS_YR`, `AREA`, `WATERBODY`, and `POP_ID`.

## Notes on the tiny demo

The legacy 30-row `nuseds-fraser-coho-sample.csv` file remains in place as the
fastest built-in demo. Its bundled example metadata continues to live in:

- `inst/extdata/dataset.csv`
- `inst/extdata/tables.csv`
- `inst/extdata/column_dictionary.csv`

Use the tiny sample when you want the quickest end-to-end walkthrough. Use the
173-row official slice when you want something closer to real Fraser coho data
without shipping the full NuSEDS workbook.

The fuller example also ships with a matching starter dictionary,
`nuseds-fraser-coho-2023-2024-column_dictionary.csv`, so you can use it
directly as an LLM context file or as a seed for manual review.
