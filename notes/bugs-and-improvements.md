# metasalmon — bugs & improvement backlog

Findings from the 2026-06-24 architecture-plan review (multi-agent code reading +
two adversarial verification passes + author spot-checks). Each item cites
`file:line`.

**Verification status legend**
- **confirmed** — an adversarial verifier read the cited code and upheld it.
- **spot-verified** — the author read the code firsthand this session.
- **finder-verified** — surfaced by a focused finder agent with line-level tracing
  but not independently re-verified (the second adversarial pass was cut short by
  the org spend limit).
- **unverified** — evidence-cited but the adversarial verifier errored on the
  spend limit; re-confirm before acting.
- **by-design** — investigated and judged intended behavior (kept for the record).

Severity = how much it can bite a real user.

**Implementation status legend (updated 2026-07-28 on `feature/theme-a-semantic-review`)**
- **fixed** — implemented on this branch and covered by focused tests.
- **done-for-plan** — the refactor-plan objective was completed, but a broader
  future improvement may remain.
- **partially addressed** — risk was reduced or documented, but the underlying
  backlog item is not exhausted.
- **open** — still present in the codebase.
- **deferred** — deliberately left out of the current refactor because it belongs
  to a separate roadmap or would change behavior beyond the plan.

**Current snapshot (updated 2026-08-11, after 0.2.4).**

- **Closed:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #10, #11, #12, #14, #15, #16, #17, #18,
  #19, #20, #21, #25, #27, #28, #32, #34–#42 (the 0.2.0 P0 remediation), and
  #64–#71 (defects in the 0.2.0 fixes themselves, caught in PR #11 review).
- **Closed with a correction to a previously wrong marker:** #9 and #33 — both
  had been marked fixed but were not verifiable from a clean clone. See each item.
- **Partially addressed:** #26, #29, #30.
- **Open:** #3, #13, #22, #23, #24, #31, #44, #48, #49, #53, #55–#61, #73.
- **Fixed by release:** #63 in the 0.2.0 merge; #43 and #62 in 0.2.1; #45, #46
  and #50 in 0.2.2; #47, #51 and #52 in 0.2.3; #54 and #72 in 0.2.4.

**Next up:** roadmap **S1** (one validation authority, #48/#49) — the last P1,
and the credibility dependency for the workshop. **S3** (KNB staging) is ready to
start in parallel and is blocked only by #73. See `notes/ROADMAP.md` for the full
ordering.

**Forward plan.** Sequencing, dependencies, and release state live in
**`notes/ROADMAP.md`** — the single undated document that orders every stream and
links to its execplan. This file stays the live index of *what is wrong*;
the roadmap decides *what order to fix it in*.

Evidence for items #34+ is in
`notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-comprehensive-ecosystem-review.md`. The two older
documents that called themselves roadmaps
(`2026-08-10-post-0.2.0-roadmap.md`, `2026-06-26-next-behaviours-roadmap.md`) are
now historical records; the second still holds the Theme A–E design detail.

**How to read this file.** Items #1–#33 came from the 2026-06-24 architecture
review. Items #34+ came from the 2026-08-10 comprehensive review; #72+ were found
during the 0.2.4 work. Priorities here are severity; *ordering* is decided in
`notes/ROADMAP.md` and the two can differ — #54 was a P2 that shipped before the
remaining P1 because it silently lost user data and was cheap. An item marked **fixed**
should name a check that proves it from a clean clone; #9 is the cautionary
example of what happens otherwise.

**Theme A implementation checkpoint (2026-07-28):** A4, A5, A2, A1, and A3
merged to `main` in PR #5 at `f774673`. The evidence pack (A0) passed its final
independent re-review after the harness was hardened to bind every captured
source artifact directly to the recorded Git commit.
Completed behavior includes:

- 30-column assessment rows with retry-rejection and escalation provenance;
- structured LLM and candidate gaps, conflict detection, and GCDFO routing;
- measurement-column bundle review with per-slot fallback and one retry round;
- strict explicit-source allowlists and omitted role-aware defaults;
- conservative method, constraint, native-type, dimension, and redundancy
  validators;
- a cross-consistent replay/live/compare/promote benchmark and exact-model
  three-run release gate.

Evidence/oracle, bundle architecture, retrieval/source-policy, gap/retry, and
ontology/I-ADOPT checkpoints have independently passed. Pkgdown, the complete
test suite, and `R CMD check` passed before the final review. That review found
additional release blockers in returned-source enforcement, retry call bounds,
chat native types, validator context locality, and evidence lineage. The fixes
and focused regressions are implemented. Re-review additionally caught and fixed
overlapping canonical field names leaking method evidence and explicit per-time
mortality rates being treated as dimensionally ambiguous. A subsequent code pass
also caught weak one-word field anchors and compound flow/speed precedence; those
now have conservative implementations and focused tests. A final adversarial
probe additionally caught suffixed identifiers and malformed compound units;
both are now rejected or left unknown with regression coverage. A markup-prefix
probe then caught the same suffix leak behind Markdown/Rmd bullets and table
markers; markup-aware token extraction now covers those forms without excluding
legitimate numbered-list prose. The final ontology matrix also found spaced and
inverse temporal denominators plus embedded compound-unit overmatching; exact
supported-compound matching and per-value powered/chained guards now cover those
forms, including inverse powers without `/` or `per`. The reviewed matrix is now
frozen for 0.1.6; broader unit algebra is not being added to this release. Final
independent review passed 38/38 frozen dimension cases, 55/55 locality cases,
replay/oracles, evidence lineage/attestation, and release documentation. Fresh
local release validation now passes: offline replay, the complete package suite
(14 expected warning assertions), source build, and `R CMD check` (`Status: OK`).
Remote pull-request and post-merge CI passed. The maintainer explicitly deferred
the exact-model live cohort when merging 0.1.6; issue #6 tracks its authentication
diagnosis and three-run completion. Default tests and CI are isolated from LLM
providers, and live benchmark execution now requires an explicit
billable-network acknowledgement.
The follow-up harness refactor reduced the complete default local suite from
about 38 minutes to 3 minutes 47 seconds; the exhaustive offline evidence tier
passes separately in about 1-2 minutes and runs only for relevant paths,
published releases, or manual dispatch.

## 0.2.0 P0 remediation (2026-08-10)

The 2026-08-10 comprehensive review
(`notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-comprehensive-ecosystem-review.md`) produced 96
adversarially-verified findings. The nine ranked P0 are all fixed on
`fix/p0-remediation` and released as 0.2.0; see `NEWS.md` for user-facing detail.

| # | Item | Where |
|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | `zip (== 3.0.1)` blocked installation against CRAN 3.0.2 | `DESCRIPTION` |
| P0-2 | Remote SDP schema loading dead; produced packages declared a rejected profile URI | `R/schema-helpers.R` |
| P0-3 | `.data$x == x` data-mask tautology applied the wrong table's rules | `R/dictionary-helpers.R`, `R/package-helpers.R` |
| P0-4 | `create_sdp()` wrote packages its own validator rejected | `R/package-helpers.R` |
| P0-5 | `read` -> edit -> `write` silently deleted reviewed sidecars | `R/package-helpers.R` |
| P0-6 | External text evaluated as a cli message template | `R/cli-safety.R` + 15 sites |
| P0-7 | Canonical bytes and identifiers depended on `LC_COLLATE` | `R/sssom.R`, `R/knb-publication.R`, others |
| P0-8 | Cancelling the term-request prompt submitted the issue | `R/term-request-helpers.R` |
| P0-9 | gcdfo validation layer inert (verified, fix deferred to the ontology repo) | `notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-gcdfo-validation-layer-verification.md` |

**Deferred from this pass, by decision:** semantic ranking tiebreakers
(`R/semantics-helpers.R:170-211`) break score ties on character keys, so with
`seed_semantics = TRUE` the top-1 pick — which becomes a written IRI in
`column_dictionary.csv` — is not reproducible across machines. Left out of the
P0 sweep deliberately: radix-ing them moves existing semantic-suggestion test
expectations, which would mix a behavioural change into a hardening pass. **This
is the highest-value remaining collation item; pick it up next.**

**Two things this pass revealed about the review process itself:**

1. A green test suite was not the signal it appeared to be. P0-2, P0-4, and the
   three unexecuted `sdp.rules.yaml` rules were all invisible to 21k lines of
   tests, because the suite pins `sdp_schema_source = "vendored"`, never
   round-trips a package through its own validator, and skips network-gated
   tests silently. One existing test in `test-edge-cases.R` was passing *because
   of* P0-3 — its `codes` fixture used `table_id = "table-1"` against a
   dictionary defaulting to `"table_1"`, and only matched because the filter was
   a no-op.
2. Two "fixed" markers in this document were wrong (#9 and #33). Both had been
   fixed in a way nobody could verify from a clean clone.

## Correctness / UX bugs

### 1. `infer_dictionary()` silently drops LLM options when `seed_semantics = FALSE`
- **Severity:** medium · **Status:** confirmed + spot-verified · **Class:** ux-bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed. `infer_dictionary()` now routes through
  `.ms_llm_review_plan()` and warns once before list/data-frame branching when
  LLM semantic options are supplied with `seed_semantics = FALSE`; regression
  coverage lives in `tests/testthat/test-dictionary-helpers.R`.
- **Where:** `R/dictionary-helpers.R:92-100` (gate at `:167`/`:243`) vs `R/package-helpers.R:462-467`.
- `infer_dictionary` defaults to `seed_semantics = FALSE`, computes `llm_requested`
  and validates context (100), but emits **no warning** when LLM options are
  supplied with `seed_semantics = FALSE` — unlike `infer_salmon_datapackage_artifacts`,
  which warns. So `infer_dictionary(df, llm_assess = TRUE)` returns deterministic
  output with no feedback. Same Alice-class surprise the 0.1.4 fix targeted, only
  half-fixed (grep confirms one `"Ignoring LLM semantic options"` string in R/).
- **Fix:** add the warning to `infer_dictionary`, emitted **once at the top of the
  function** (before the list/data.frame branch and the multi-table recursion at
  128-141), via the shared option helper from plan Refactor 2. Add a test; pre-flight
  the suite for `infer_dictionary(... llm_*)` calls lacking `expect_warning`.

### 2. Exploration with skipped reassessment pairs a stale selected-index with a re-sorted candidate set
- **Severity:** medium · **Status:** spot-verified (NEW) · **Class:** correctness-bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed (completed during 2026-06-25 code review).
  Codex's first pass only fixed the *failed-reassessment* branch
  (`R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1310`); the **no-gain skip branch** (`candidate_gain
  <= 0`, ~`:1305`) still returned the re-sorted `updated_record` with the original
  positional index — reproducing the bug on a narrower path. The code review
  caught this; the skip branch now also returns the original `record`, and a
  dedicated regression test ("no-gain exploration (candidate_gain <= 0) keeps the
  original selected index") covers it alongside the failed-reassessment test.
- **Where:** `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1166-1184` (`.ms_llm_explore_record`), with
  `.ms_merge_semantic_target_candidates` (R/semantics-helpers.R) and
  `.ms_semantic_merge_llm_assessments` (R/semantic-suggestions.R:243-268).
- When exploration adds candidates, the merged group is re-sorted by score and
  capped to `max_per_role`, and `.ms_row_order` is reset (1166). If reassessment is
  then skipped — `candidate_gain <= 0`/unchanged keys (1177) or the reassess call
  returns `NA` decision (1182) — the function returns the **re-ordered** record
  paired with the **original** assessment, whose `llm_selected_candidate_index` was
  validated against the *old* ordering. Downstream `llm_selected` is recomputed
  against the new order, so the chosen IRI can be mis-attributed to a different row
  or lost entirely (notably when the selected candidate sat at rank 4-5 with default
  `top_n = 5` but `max_per_role = 3` caps it out).
- **Impact:** an accepted ontology match silently flagged on the wrong candidate or
  dropped, after a failed/no-gain exploration pass. Narrow reach (exploration must
  fire and reassessment be skipped).
- **Fix:** key `llm_selected` on the selected candidate's stable `source::iri`
  rather than a positional index; or on skip, return the original (pre-merge) record
  with the original assessment so index and ordering stay aligned.

### 3. Duplicated, divergent HTTP chat request builders
- **Severity:** medium · **Status:** confirmed · **Class:** correctness-bug (drift)
- **Implementation status:** open/deferred. R4 intentionally deepened the
  response adapter while preserving the two current response shapes. Converging
  `.ms_llm_chat_json_request()` and `.ms_chat_http_request()` is a separate
  request-builder refactor because it would change the adapter shape decision.
- **Where:** `.ms_llm_chat_json_request` (R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1301-1330) vs
  `.ms_chat_http_request` (R/chat-decomposition.R:435-472).
- Two near-identical httr2 `/chat/completions` builders with **divergent** behavior:
  the semantic one applies `.ms_llm_build_chat_request_body` (temperature /
  reasoning-effort / GPT-5 omit-temperature) and returns a bare list; the chat one
  hardcodes temperature and returns `list(content, data, raw)`. OpenRouter headers
  are duplicated. This divergence is *why* the review adapter needs a two-shape
  normalizer.
- **Fix:** extract a shared chat request builder. NOTE: doing so is **mutually
  exclusive** with keeping the adapter's dual-shape normalizer — track as its own
  refactor, not inside plan R4 (see plan Missing/Future #2).

### 4. `create_sdp(include_edh_xml = TRUE)` writes EDH XML bypassing the unreviewed-rebuild guard
- **Severity:** low-medium · **Status:** finder-verified (NEW; likely intended) · **Class:** ux-bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed (2026-06-26, roadmap B1). `create_sdp()` still
  writes create-time EDH XML, but now reuses `.ms_collect_edh_review_state_issues()`
  and emits a "DRAFT EDH" warning (pointing to `write_edh_xml_from_sdp()`) when
  `REVIEW:`/`MISSING` markers remain. Decision: draft marker, not a hard guard
  (create-time output is inherently review-ready). Test in `test-package-helpers.R`.
- **Where:** `R/package-helpers.R:951-960` vs `R/edh-xml-export.R:1176-1200, 1270`
  (`.ms_abort_unreviewed_edh_rebuild`).
- `write_edh_xml_from_sdp` refuses to build when `REVIEW:` IRIs or `MISSING`
  placeholders remain. `create_sdp`'s inline `include_edh_xml` path calls
  `edh_build_hnap_xml` directly on `artifacts$dataset_meta` with **no** such guard,
  at a stage where `dataset_meta` routinely still has `MISSING METADATA` placeholders.
  So first-write XML can be emitted from unreviewed metadata while a later rebuild of
  the same package is refused.
- **Fix:** document that create_sdp-time EDH XML is a draft, or route it through a
  shared builder that stamps/blocks when placeholders/REVIEW markers are present.

### 5. `chunk_id` / source-label collisions for context files sharing a basename
- **Severity:** low · **Status:** confirmed · **Class:** architectural-smell
- **Implementation status:** fixed (2026-06-26, roadmap D2).
  `.ms_unique_context_sources()` disambiguates colliding basenames (parent dir, then
  a numeric suffix) inside `.ms_collect_context_chunks()`; unique labels are left
  untouched so the observable `llm_context_sources` contract is preserved. Test in
  `test-llm-semantic-helpers.R`.
- **Where:** `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:530, 549-551, 619`; consumed at
  `R/llm-review-adapter.R:112`.
- `source = basename(normalizePath(path))` and `chunk_id = paste0(source, "#", i)`.
  Two files with the same basename in different dirs collide, and the user-visible
  `llm_context_sources` column (`unique(source)`) merges them.
- **Fix:** disambiguate colliding basenames; relevant because the plan promises to
  "preserve source reporting exactly."

### 6. Encoding mismatch can corrupt non-UTF-8 context files
- **Severity:** low · **Status:** confirmed · **Class:** architectural-smell
- **Implementation status:** fixed (2026-06-26, roadmap D1). `.ms_read_text_utf8()`
  reads the main plain-text/CSV path as UTF-8, detects invalid UTF-8 via
  `validUTF8()`, and falls back to Windows-1252/Latin-1 decoding. Test in
  `test-llm-semantic-helpers.R`. (The `.Rmd`/`.qmd`/HTML readers still assume UTF-8
  — they are normally UTF-8 authored.)
- **Where:** `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:376, 518, 521`. `readLines(..., encoding = "UTF-8")`
  then `enc2utf8` for non-UTF-8 inputs (e.g. Latin-1 CSVs) corrupts tokens and
  degrades scoring. **Fix:** detect/allow encoding in one place.

### 7. Provider truncation reported as a generic null-response abort
- **Severity:** low · **Status:** confirmed · **Class:** ux-bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed. The review adapter now includes a sanitized
  content snippet when wrapped chat content is malformed and parsed `data` is not
  available; tests also assert parsed `data` wins over malformed `content`.
- **Where:** `R/llm-review-adapter.R:8-16`. When `data` is NULL and `content` is
  non-JSON (truncated/streamed), `fromJSON` fails in a `tryCatch`→NULL and the
  function aborts with a generic message, discarding the raw content. **Fix:**
  surface a content snippet; assert in malformed-response tests for both consumers.

### 8. `semantic_code_scope = "factor"` semi-join omits `dataset_id`
- **Severity:** low · **Status:** finder-verified (NEW; latent) · **Class:** correctness-bug (latent)
- **Implementation status:** fixed (2026-06-26, roadmap D3).
  `.ms_factor_code_keys()` / `.ms_select_semantic_seed_codes()` now thread
  `dataset_id` and join on `c("dataset_id","table_id","column_name")` when present
  (no behavior change on the single-dataset path). Test in `test-package-helpers.R`.
- **Where:** `R/package-helpers.R:2554` (`.ms_select_semantic_seed_codes` semi-join by
  `c("table_id","column_name")`); `.ms_factor_code_keys` (2200-2219).
- Safe today (single uniform `dataset_id` per run), but if `seed_codes` ever span
  multiple datasets with colliding `table_id`/`column_name`, factor-scope selection
  cross-matches across datasets. **Fix:** include `dataset_id` in the key when present.

### 9. `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` circular self-reference
- **Severity:** low (repo hygiene) · **Status:** spot-verified · **Class:** ux-bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed 2026-06-26 in a *working copy only*; genuinely
  fixed 2026-08-10. The 2026-06-26 pass wrote real guidance into `AGENTS.md`, but
  `.gitignore` listed `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, so neither file was ever
  committed and the shipped repo still carried no contributor guidance — the exact
  symptom this item describes. The ignore entries are removed as of 0.2.0 and both
  files are tracked; both remain in `.Rbuildignore`, so the built package is
  unaffected, and the generated `docs/AGENTS.html`/`docs/CLAUDE.html` stay ignored.
  **Lesson for this document:** a "fixed" marker that nobody can verify from a
  clean clone is worse than an open item. Prefer claims a CI check can assert
  (here: `git ls-files AGENTS.md` is non-empty).
- Both files contain only `@AGENTS.md`; `AGENTS.md` references itself → no agent
  guidance ships, and the include is circular. **Fix:** seed real `AGENTS.md` from
  `notes/context.md` (LLM opt-in contract, attribute/IRI-prefix contracts, commands).

---

## LLM-review robustness (new finder bugs, low severity)

These are batch/exploration robustness gaps. Output correctness is preserved
(fallbacks exist) but behavior is poor. **Status: finder-verified, unverified by the
adversarial pass** — re-confirm before fixing.

### 10. Batch system prompt omits `reject_shortlist` from allowed decisions
- **Implementation status:** fixed. Generic, decomposition, and batch prompts now
  list `reject_shortlist` consistently with the validator.
- `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:891` lists only `accept, review, retry_search,
  request_new_term`, but the validator (`:1338`) also accepts `reject_shortlist`.
  In batched review the model is never told it may reject → behavior diverges from
  the single-target path. **Fix:** add `reject_shortlist` to the batch prompt.

### 11. One malformed batch item aborts and discards all valid assessments
- **Implementation status:** fixed. Batch validation now catches malformed items
  per target key, preserves valid sibling rows, and falls back only affected keys
  to per-target review.
- `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1483-1500` calls `.ms_validate_llm_assessment` per item,
  which **aborts** (not warns) on a single bad confidence/decision; the abort voids
  the whole batch and forces a full per-target re-run (1520-1530), doubling requests.
  **Fix:** `tryCatch` per item, treat a bad item as a missing key so only it falls back.

### 12. Duplicate `target_key` in a batch response silently overwrites
- **Implementation status:** fixed. Duplicate target keys are detected and the
  affected key is routed to fallback review instead of silently overwriting the
  first assessment.
- `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1483-1490` writes `rows[[key]] <- ...` without checking
  for an existing key; a model echoing a duplicate key silently drops the first.
  **Fix:** detect already-assigned keys; warn/fall back for the affected key.

### 13. `retry_search` can re-issue the original failing query
- **Implementation status:** fixed on `feature/theme-a-semantic-review`.
  Case/whitespace-normalized exact duplicates preserve `retry_search` and the
  original query, record `duplicate_original_query`, and skip query generation,
  retrieval, and reassessment for that slot. Identifier-like duplicates are
  classified before identifier fallback; near-duplicates remain eligible.
- `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1089-1098, 1129-1138`: if the model's `retry_query`
  equals the original, validation drops it and the code silently falls through to a
  generic exploration request — the explicit `retry_query` has no effect and an extra
  round-trip is spent. **Fix:** record the rejection; consider honoring near-duplicates.

### 33. Canonical project and runtime URLs point to the former organization
- **Severity:** medium · **Status:** spot-verified · **Class:** reliability/ux-bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed (2026-07-21). Package metadata, install and
  help links, update checks, OpenRouter attribution, tests, and source
  documentation now use `salmon-data-mobilization/metasalmon`. Runtime SDP
  schema fetches use the verified raw endpoint in
  `salmon-data-mobilization/smn-data-pkg`; focused tests and a live remote-schema
  smoke load passed. The full suite passed 1,356 tests, and
  `R CMD check metasalmon_0.1.5.9000.tar.gz` completed with `Status: OK`.
- **Where:** `DESCRIPTION`, `_pkgdown.yml`, `R/version-check.R`,
  `R/schema-helpers.R`, the two OpenRouter request paths, README/vignettes, and
  generated reference/site output.
- The package had moved to `salmon-data-mobilization`, but public install/help
  URLs and the default update check still targeted the independently existing
  `dfo-pacific-science/metasalmon` repository. The remote schema loader likewise
  fetched from the former `smn-data-pkg` repository.
- **Follow-up (2026-08-04):** upstream PRs
  `salmon-data-mobilization/smn-data-pkg#2` and `#3` added the observation/method
  extension and moved the profile, rules, and resource-schema identifiers to the
  active `salmon-data-mobilization.github.io/smn-data-pkg` Pages site. Pages and
  every published artifact were verified byte-for-byte. metasalmon now vendors
  that exact bundle while still keeping contract identifiers distinct from the
  configurable raw-GitHub retrieval source.
- **Compatibility decision (SUPERSEDED 2026-08-10):** the original decision was
  "do not rewrite the SDP 0.2 profile/resource-schema identifiers, because
  upstream still defines the former GitHub Pages URI as the contract value."
  That premise is no longer true — upstream `smn-data-pkg` migrated every `$id`,
  `properties.profile.const`, and `rules.profile` to
  `salmon-data-mobilization.github.io`. Because `.ms_validate_sdp_schema()`
  asserted equality against the hardcoded legacy constant, `source = "remote"`
  aborted outright and the default `"auto"` silently fell back to the stale
  vendored bundle, so every `datapackage.json` metasalmon wrote declared a
  profile URI the live upstream profile's `const` rejects. Invisible to the
  suite because `helper-validation.R` pins `sdp_schema_source = "vendored"` and
  nothing exercised a successful remote fetch.
- **Replacement decision:** identity is **derived from the loaded bundle**, and
  validation checks only internal self-consistency. The vendored files are
  re-vendored from upstream rather than hand-edited. This is what makes an
  upstream identifier change followable. Fixed on `fix/p0-remediation`; the
  gap is closed by a live remote-fetch test.

## Architectural smells (the duplication driving the refactors)

Correctness-neutral today; drift risks. Cross-referenced to plan refactors R1–R5.

### 14. Triplicated 11-arg `llm_*` forwarding tail  → R2
- **Status:** confirmed (count corrected). The conditional 11-arg `llm_*` block is
  verbatim at **three** sites: `R/dictionary-helpers.R:180-193`, `:256-269`, and
  `R/package-helpers.R:551-564`. **Correction:** the earlier "quadruple duplication"
  framing was wrong — `create_sdp:831-855` is an *unconditional full ~21-arg
  pass-through* of the whole artifact surface, **not** a copy of the 11-arg LLM tail.
- **Implementation status:** fixed. The conditional LLM tail now lives in
  `.ms_llm_review_plan()`, while caller-specific base `suggest_args` remain owned
  by each public entry point.

### 15. `llm_requested` 8-clause predicate duplicated  → R2
- **Status:** confirmed. Byte-identical at `R/dictionary-helpers.R:92-99` and
  `R/package-helpers.R:452-459`.
- **Implementation status:** fixed. The predicate is centralized in
  `.ms_llm_review_requested()` and consumed through `.ms_llm_review_plan()`.

### 16. Divergent column-target builders  → R3
- **Status:** confirmed (re-characterized). `.ms_semantic_column_term_target_from_dictionary`
  (R/semantic-suggestions.R:147-185) and the inline block (R/semantics-helpers.R:966-984)
  are **divergent, not duplicates**: the inline block expands all six I-ADOPT roles
  and sets `target_sdp_field = col_name`; the standalone hardcodes a single
  variable/`term_iri` row and computes `target_query_basis/context` the inline block
  leaves NA. The standalone is currently only a **fallback** inside
  `.ms_semantic_target_from_candidate_rows` (197-201) when retrieval is empty.
  **Fix:** reconcile deliberately — do not blindly "collapse."
- **Implementation status:** done-for-plan. Full semantic target discovery moved
  into `.ms_semantic_discover_targets()` with direct tests for all SDP scopes.
  The narrow candidate-row fallback remains intentionally separate and documented
  rather than collapsed into the six-role discovery path.

### 17. Divergent `infer_dictionary` attribute schemes  → R5
- **Status:** confirmed. Multi-table attaches `inferred_*` unconditionally (196-199,
  tested at test-dictionary-helpers.R:308-311); single-table attaches `seed_*` only
  when args non-NULL (272-280). Disjoint sets. Both are contract.
- **Implementation status:** done-for-plan. R5 preserved both public attribute
  schemes and added tests pinning the single-table `seed_*` contract and absence
  of multi-table `inferred_*` attributes.

### 18. `include_dwc` inconsistency in `suggest_semantics` arg assembly  → R2
- **Status:** confirmed. `R/package-helpers.R:546` sets `include_dwc = FALSE`; both
  dictionary base lists omit it (rely on default). Centralizing must **preserve
  per-caller behavior**, not unify (it would be a behavior change).
- **Implementation status:** fixed. `.ms_llm_review_plan()` centralizes only the
  conditional LLM tail; caller-specific base arguments, including artifact-path
  `include_dwc = FALSE`, remain local.

### 19. Implicit/positional 19-col target-row contract  → R3
- **Status:** confirmed. Builders hand-write column lists instead of constructing from
  `.ms_semantic_target_cols()`; retrieval copies via `intersect(...)` so an omitted
  column drops silently (R/semantics-helpers.R:106-109).
- **Implementation status:** done-for-plan. The target row column order is now
  frozen by tests, and `.ms_semantic_discover_targets()` returns normalized rows
  across column/code/table/dataset scopes. This reduces silent-drift risk; it does
  not remove every positional read in downstream consumers.

### 20. Thin pass-through wrappers add a file-hop  → R4
- **Status:** confirmed (nuance). `.ms_empty_llm_assessment` is pass-through, but
  `.ms_llm_success_assessment` (R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1415-1423) **unpacks the
  record struct** — inlining must move record-unpacking or keep a positional adapter
  signature.
- **Implementation status:** fixed. The thin semantic wrappers were removed;
  orchestration now calls adapter row builders directly while record unpacking
  stays outside the adapter.

### 21. `table_meta`/`dataset_meta` targets emit extra columns  → R3
- **Status:** confirmed. Table targets add `target_query_basis/context` (1063-1064);
  column/code/dataset omit them (NA-backfilled at 1109). Preserve the backfill.
- **Implementation status:** done-for-plan. R3 preserved the backfilled canonical
  target-column shape and added target-discovery tests covering table and dataset
  target rows.

### 22. Merge helper drops a `.ms_bundle_key` it never created  → R3/R4
- **Status:** confirmed. `.ms_semantic_merge_llm_assessments` (R/semantic-suggestions.R:251-267)
  drops `.ms_bundle_key` via `any_of` though it never creates it — a copy-from-the-inline-pipeline smell.
- **Implementation status:** open. The harmless defensive drop remains; removing
  it was not required for the R3/R4 behavioral work.

### 23. Multi-table recursion forwards the un-widened shortlist  → R2/R5
- **Status:** confirmed (latent). `R/dictionary-helpers.R:136` passes
  `semantic_max_per_role`, not `semantic_seed_max_per_role`. Harmless today (children
  force `seed_semantics = FALSE`) but a trap if seeding ever moves into the recursion.
- **Implementation status:** open latent. R5 moved resource-dictionary inference
  behind `.ms_infer_resource_dictionary()` but preserved child calls with
  `seed_semantics = FALSE`; if semantic seeding later moves into child recursion,
  this needs to be revisited.

### 24. Decomposition mode disables batching for the whole group
- **Status:** by-design (perf note). `any(record$decomposition_mode)` at
  `R/llm-semantic-helpers.R:1503` forces per-target review. Correct; a quiet perf
  cliff worth a debug log.
- **Implementation status:** open/by-design. No debug log was added in this
  branch.

---

## Reclassified as by-design (not bugs)

- **Positional `[[1]]` row access throughout discovery closures** (R/semantics-helpers.R:425-942)
  — intended single-row tibble contract; refactor-sensitive but not a defect.
- **Normalizer "masks" shape drift between discovery blocks** (R/semantics-helpers.R:1109)
  — the NA backfill is the intended mechanism; the inconsistent per-builder column
  sets (#21) are the smell, not the backfill.

---

## Test / infra improvements (evidence-cited; unverified by the adversarial pass)

### 25. White-box parse-once test couples to internal helper names slated for relocation
- **Implementation status:** fixed for current refactor. The parse-once invariant
  now flows through an explicit `context_chunk_pool`, and tests were updated to
  exercise that pool rather than relying on implicit reparsing.
- `tests/testthat/test-llm-semantic-helpers.R:1100-1136` mocks
  `.ms_context_text_from_file` and `.ms_chunk_context_text` by name. Plan R1's
  wrapper-deletion step breaks this unless the symbols survive or the test is
  rewritten through the new seam first.

### 26. Network-gated tests weaken the validation ladder
- **Implementation status:** partially addressed. Release validation now includes
  the full test suite and a standard `R CMD check` with all declared suggested R
  packages installed; the 0.1.5 check finished with `Status: OK`. The
  network-gated tests themselves were not rewritten, so a green offline run still
  does not prove the live services are reachable.
- `tests/testthat/test-validation-helpers.R:80-96` (`fetch_salmon_ontology`, live HEAD
  to w3id.org) and GitHub helpers skip silently offline. Lean R3/R5 gating on
  `test-package-helpers.R` and `test-dictionary-helpers.R`; assert skip-count doesn't
  rise across refactors.

### 27. Massive dictionary-fixture duplication (~30 copies)
- **Implementation status:** fixed for current refactor. Added shared fixtures in
  `tests/testthat/helper-dictionary.R` and migrated ordinary repeated dictionary
  fixtures before R3/R5 changes.
- The canonical dict tibble is copy-pasted across test files. R3/R5 change row/column
  shape, so consolidate into `helper-dictionary.R` **before** those refactors.

### 28. `semantic-suggestions` module under-tested
- **Implementation status:** fixed for current refactor. `test-semantic-suggestions.R`
  now covers semantic target row contracts, target discovery, LLM assessment row
  contracts, and review-adapter robustness cases.
- `tests/testthat/test-semantic-suggestions.R` has only 2 `test_that` blocks despite
  being the destination for R3's target rows and a consumer in R4.

### 32. Display-only vignettes are tangled and executed by `R CMD check`
- **Severity:** low-medium · **Status:** confirmed · **Class:** test-infra bug
- **Implementation status:** fixed (2026-07-21, roadmap E5). Every display-only
  chunk in the six affected vignettes now declares `purl = FALSE` in its chunk
  header. A focused `knitr::purl()` validation found zero executable lines, and
  `R CMD check metasalmon_0.1.5.tar.gz` completed with `Status: OK` while pkgdown
  continued to render the examples.
- A global runtime `knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE)` is
  insufficient because the check's tangle phase does not execute the setup chunk.
  Without per-chunk metadata it tried to run credential, network, and local-file
  examples that were intended only for display.

---

## Larger opportunities (future refactors, not the current plan)

### 29. `package-helpers.R` is a ~2975-line god-file
- **Implementation status:** partially addressed. R5 created
  `R/artifact-inference.R` and moved package artifact inference context there.
  `package-helpers.R` remains large and still owns writing, reading, validation,
  `create_sdp()`, and EDH post-processing.
- Mixes `write_salmon_datapackage` (53), `infer_salmon_datapackage_artifacts` (427),
  `create_sdp` (712), `read_salmon_datapackage` (1008), `validate_salmon_datapackage`
  (1292), and a composite-hint cluster (1955-2490). **Recommendation:** land plan R5's
  orchestration extraction in a *new* file (e.g. `R/artifact-inference.R`) to capture
  the Locality win instead of deepening inside the god-file.

### 30. `infer_*_from_resources` defined in `dictionary-helpers.R` but core to the package path
- **Implementation status:** partially addressed/open. The package path now uses
  the new artifact-inference helper for orchestration, but the exported/resource
  inference helpers themselves still live in `dictionary-helpers.R`.
- Defined at `R/dictionary-helpers.R:442-629`, consumed by
  `infer_salmon_datapackage_artifacts` (package-helpers.R:508-525). Misplaced
  ownership — part of R5's case.

### 31. Chat session-engine / request-builder convergence (i-adopt roadmap)
- **Implementation status:** open/deferred. R4 hardened the shared response
  validation seam only; request-builder/session-engine convergence remains a
  separate roadmap item.
- `chat-decomposition.R` (~1346 lines) duplicates request/provider logic with the
  semantic path (#3). The i-adopt roadmap wants decomposition to be one mode in a
  shared curation engine; converging the request builders is the request-side half of
  that (R4 only unifies the response-validation seam).

## 2026-08-10 comprehensive review (items #34+)

Findings from the 2026-08-10 multi-agent review (145 raw findings, 96 surviving
refute-by-default adversarial verification). Full evidence and failure scenarios
are in `notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-comprehensive-ecosystem-review.md`; this
section is the live index. Priority tags refer to
`notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-post-0.2.0-roadmap.md`.

### Fixed in 0.2.0

**#34 `zip (== 3.0.1)` blocked installation.** CRAN ships 3.0.2, so the exact pin
could not be satisfied. **The first fix was incomplete and CI caught it:**
relaxing `DESCRIPTION` to `>=` left the runtime guard
`.ms_knb_require_zip_version()` as an equally exact check, so the package
installed and then aborted on every KNB publication path — 10 test failures on a
runner with zip 3.0.2, invisible locally because the dev machine had 3.0.1.
Fixed properly: the guard is a reviewed-version allowlist
(`.ms_knb_reviewed_zip_versions`), and 3.0.1/3.0.2 were byte-compared for
metasalmon's exact `zip::zip()` call across nested paths, non-ASCII filenames, an
empty file, incompressible and highly compressible content — identical archives.
*Proof from a clean clone:* `test-knb-sdp-archive.R` asserts DESCRIPTION carries
`>=` not `==`, that its floor is a version the guard accepts, and — the check
that would have caught this — that **the installed zip version is one the guard
accepts**, which runs against whatever CI installs.
*Lesson:* a dependency relaxation must be checked against the version the
relaxation admits, not the one the developer happens to have.

**#35 Remote SDP schema loading was dead; produced packages declared a rejected
profile URI.** `.ms_validate_sdp_schema()` asserted equality against a hardcoded
legacy `$id` after upstream migrated. Fixed: identity is derived from the loaded
bundle; validation checks only internal self-consistency. *Proof:* a live
remote-fetch test, plus a bundle-identity test using a fabricated URI. Supersedes
the compatibility decision in #33.

**#36 `.data$x == x` data-mask tautologies.** Three sites; a multi-table
dictionary was applied in full and other datasets' columns leaked into
`datapackage.json`. Fixed with `.env$` pinning. *Proof:* multi-table and
multi-dataset regression tests. One pre-existing test was passing *because of*
this bug and its fixture was corrected.

**#37 `create_sdp()` wrote packages its own validator rejected.** readr re-guessed
character code values (`"0.10"` -> `0.1`, `100000` -> `"1e+05"`). Fixed:
dictionary-driven `col_types` plus a type-aware code comparison. Also fixed
`infer_value_type()` collapsing `POSIXt` to `date`.

**#38 `read` -> edit -> `write` silently deleted reviewed sidecars.** Fixed:
`.ms_package_managed_paths()` limits deletion to writer-owned files; opt-in
`prune = TRUE` restores the old behaviour.

**#39 External text was evaluated as a cli message template.** A provider error
containing braces could print an API key; an unbalanced brace replaced the
message with a parse error. Fixed: `R/cli-safety.R` + 15 sites + boundary
redaction. *Proof:* `test-cli-safety-guard.R`, an AST walk with a self-test.

**#40 Canonical bytes and identifiers depended on `LC_COLLATE`.** ~20 sites
including the resource-map PID and SSSOM canonical bytes. Fixed with explicit C
collation and `dplyr (>= 1.1.0)`. *Proof:* golden-value tests plus
`test-collation-guard.R`. See #43 for the one deliberate exclusion.

**#41 Cancelling a term-request prompt submitted the issue.** `askYesNo()` returns
`NA` on cancel and the guard tested `isFALSE()`. Two sibling bugs in the same
function: `menu()` returning `0` aborted the loop, and the candidate lines passed
cli markup to `glue::glue()`, which fails to parse on every input — so interactive
routing had never worked. All three fixed.

**#42 Repo hygiene: `tmp/` and a dead `.Rbuildignore` regex.** `^\.tmp$` never
matched anything, and the 1.5 MB `tmp/` directory was excluded by neither ignore
file. Fixed: `^tmp(/|$)` in `.Rbuildignore`, `tmp/` in `.gitignore`.

### Fixed during PR #11 review (defects in the 0.2.0 fixes themselves)

Fourteen rounds of automated review on PR #11 found real defects in code written
*for* this release — none in pre-existing code. Recorded because the failure
modes are systematic, not incidental, and the same shapes will recur.

**#64 Type conversion took four rounds of symptom patching before the
structural fix.** Each round fixed the case in front of it (scientific notation,
then precision, then whole-number checks, then datetime sub-second) while
leaving the next one. The fix that held changed the *approach*: read every
column as text, convert in memory, and verify the result against the original
token rather than against another parse. **Lesson:** when a fix needs a third
special case, the design is wrong, not incomplete.

**#65 The cli guard's own allowlist hid a live credential leak.** Allowlisting
`.ms_sdp_decomposition_abort()` as a "wrapper that forwards a caller template"
meant its callers were never examined — and one built its message from
user-supplied column names, so a column named `{Sys.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}`
had its value interpolated into an error. Treating the wrappers as cli message
functions surfaced two further unescaped sites. **Lesson:** an allowlist entry
is an assertion about every call site, and a guard's exemptions deserve the same
scrutiny as the code it guards.

**#66 A fix applied to `metadata/` but not to the root-level shadows.** The
managed-path inventory covered both; the pre-read containment check added two
commits later covered only `metadata/`, so a symlinked root `tables.csv` was
parsed before the guard ran. **#67 The same containment check never inspected
the package root itself** — it walked components *below* `path`, so a symlinked
root left every child looking contained and `prune = TRUE` would have emptied
the link's target.

**#68 Blank, then padded, schema identifiers.** `sdp:version` gained a
well-formedness check; `sdp:rules` three lines away did not. Adding it used
`nzchar()` where the neighbours used `nzchar(trimws())`, so an all-whitespace
bundle agreed with itself and passed. Fixing *that* still compared and stored the
raw value, so consistent padding reached `datapackage.json`. Settled by
normalising at the boundary. **Lesson (shared with #66/#67):** the recurring
shape is fixing one instance and missing its neighbour. After any fix, ask what
else is in the same list, the same file, or the same call path.

**#69 A safeguard tested only against inputs its author imagined.** The
hard-link fix was placed in the caller; a reproduction calling the writer
directly still truncated. **#70 A platform-dependent float quirk was asserted as
universal** — a macOS `readr::parse_double()` result that Linux disagreed with,
caught by CI. Replaced with a fixed exponent band rather than a
platform-conditional assertion.

**#71 An exported row order was locale-dependent through a numeric sort.**
`detect_semantic_term_gaps()` ordered by `placement_confidence` alone; `order()`
is stable, so ties kept the order of `split()`'s factor levels — which come from
a locale-collated sort. The reported finding was only the adjacent character
tie-breaker. **Lesson:** a numeric sort key does not make an ordering
locale-safe; only a *total* order does.

### Fixed in 0.2.4

**#72 `ms_setup_github()` defaulted to a private dataset repo in the old org.**
Found while explaining a CI skip, not by the sweep that should have caught it.
`repo` is now optional: supply it to verify access, omit it to set up the PAT
alone. The test fixtures point at metasalmon's own **public** repository, so the
GitHub read helpers are now exercised everywhere including CI instead of
skipping on a 404 — turning two long-standing CI skips into real coverage.

Worth noting for future sweeps: this is the same class as #62 (a hardcoded
contract value in general-purpose API) and it survived the 0.2.0 pass because
that pass searched for hardcoded *schema* URIs specifically rather than for the
pattern.

#### More fixed in 0.2.4

**#54 The canonical CSV round trip destroyed literal `"NA"` code values.**
Reproduced, and worse than the finding stated: the **written bytes were
identical** for a literal `"NA"` and a missing value, so the loss happened at
write time and no reader could have recovered it. readr's own defaults disagree
— it writes `NA` and reads `c("", "NA")`. Both sides now use a single token,
`""`, defined in one place (`.ms_csv_na_token()`) because the contract is only
sound if the two sides agree and they live in different files.

Three EML tests changed with it, and the direction is worth recording: the
fixture declared `missingValueCode = "NA"`, which described the old bytes. With
one token there is no non-empty missing token left to declare, so EML now
represents absence directly instead of through a code that collided with real
data — and the "undeclared non-empty missing token" guard became unreachable
through the canonical writer. It is retained and now asserted as an invariant
rather than as a failure.

Note the `""`-vs-`NA` ambiguity is **not** new: the old reader mapped an empty
field to missing too, so an empty string never survived either. This change does
not narrow that.

#### Also fixed in 0.2.4

**Five DataONE adapter tests had never executed anywhere.** Not a numbered
backlog item — it came out of the roadmap's own process note about silent
skips, and it is recorded here because of what it demonstrates.
`R-CMD-check.yaml` installed only `devtools` and `rcmdcheck`, so `{dataone}` and
`{datapack}` were absent in CI as well as on development machines, and five
tests covering the boundary that talks to the repository during live publication
skipped silently on every run. They pass — but that was unknown, and a
regression there would have been invisible.

CI installs them now, and `test-ci-optional-deps.R` fails the build when an
optional package the suite needs is absent *in CI*, while still skipping
locally, where a missing optional package is an environment fact rather than a
workflow regression. A check-workflow run should report exactly four skips: the
Theme A integrity tests, which run in `theme-a-integrity.yaml`.

### Fixed in 0.2.3

**#47 `publish_sdp_to_knb()` could not re-plan after any edit.** Reproduced
end-to-end, and it was **three** gates rather than one: the SDP archive writer,
the plan-mismatch check, and the resource-map ownership check each treated an
existing artifact as a published artifact. Clearing the first only moved the
failure to the second. The original finding's "no override" was accurate for the
entry point even though the individual writers have `overwrite` — the parameter
was simply not reachable from `publish_sdp_to_knb()`.

Fixed by one principle rather than three patches: an artifact left by an
**unpublished dry run** may be replaced when `overwrite = TRUE`, because no PID
was ever minted for it. A manifest whose status is not `dry_run` still requires
a reviewed revision, and live publication is still gated by `confirm`. All three
messages now name the remedy.

**#51 The default LLM providers never retried.** `.ms_llm_retry_limit()`
returned 1 attempt for everything except two special-cased models, so
`attempt >= attempts` was true on the first pass and the retryable-error
classifier below it was unreachable — a 429 or 503 failed the whole review on
the first try, after the user had paid for every preceding request.
`Retry-After` is now honoured in both wire formats and capped, with jittered
exponential backoff otherwise so a batch hitting one rate limit does not retry
in lockstep.

**#52 The BioPortal API key travelled in the request URL.** Now an
`Authorization` header, with URLs redacted before display or recording.

### Fixed in 0.2.2

**#45 The term-search index cache never prevented work.** Both index builders
checked their cache stamp *after* fetching and parsing, so every `find_terms()`
call paid 11 conditional GETs and a full reparse before it could discover that
nothing had changed. An index is now resolved once per session, with
`refresh = TRUE` as the escape hatch. The trade — no mid-session pickup of an
upstream module update — is deliberate and matches the schema bundle's
session-stable identity decision; it is also the stronger guarantee for seeding,
where two columns in one package must not be seeded against two ontology
versions.

**#46 `METASALMON_CACHE` was read at build time.** A top-level binding is
evaluated when the namespace is built, so an installed package captured the
build machine's environment. Only `pkgload::load_all()` ever saw the developer's
own setting, which is why it looked like it worked.

**#50 Vocabulary HTTP failures were reported as successful zero-result
searches.** `.safe_json()` returned `NULL` for both a failure and a genuine
empty, every caller collapsed that into `.empty_terms()`, and the diagnostic
recorded `status = "success", count = 0` — the exact input that drives
`request_new_term` escalation, so an outage manufactured ontology gaps.
Failures are now signalled (not thrown — some calls are optional enrichment
inside a per-term map), recorded as `status = "http_error"` in the
`diagnostics` attribute, and warned about; a degraded lookup is never cached.

### Fixed in 0.2.1

**#43 Semantic ranking tiebreakers made seeded IRIs non-reproducible.** Score
ties broke on character keys (`source`, `ontology`, `label`, `iri`), and with
`seed_semantics = TRUE` the top-1 pick becomes a written IRI in
`column_dictionary.csv` — so the same input seeded differently on macOS and in a
C-locale container. Fixed across all nine ordering sites in
`R/semantics-helpers.R` and `R/term_search.R`, with seven functions added to
`collation_sensitive_fns`. **This was the last locale-dependence in the
package.**

Two things worth recording. The deferral rationale — that radix-ing it would
move semantic-suggestion test expectations — turned out to be **wrong**: zero
expectations changed, because the fixtures are lowercase ASCII where C and the
ambient locale agree. That is also precisely why the bug was invisible.
Separately, `.apply_embedding_rerank()` selected its rerank set with
`order(-score)` alone, so *which* rows were reranked depended on input order;
it now tie-breaks on `label`.

**#62 `.ms_sdp_public_schema_base()` was a hardcoded contract value.** It built
the per-resource schema URLs written into descriptors, carrying the same drift
risk that broke remote schema loading before 0.2.0 (#35).
`.ms_sdp_metadata_resource_schema()` now reads the bundle's
`sdp:metadataResources` entry of that name, so every URI in a written
`datapackage.json` — profile, rules, and per-resource schemas — comes from one
validated bundle. The constant survives as the fallback for a bundle predating
the v0.2 extension resources.

### Open — P1 (highest value next)

**#63 The 0.1.8 extension normalizers shipped with locale-dependent ordering.**
`.ms_sdp_methods_normalize()` and the two
`.ms_sdp_observation_normalize_*()` functions produce the canonical row order
written to `metadata/methods.csv` and `metadata/structure/observation_*.csv`, and
`extract_sdp_observations()` orders returned data by dimension columns — all with
bare `dplyr::arrange()`. Fixed during the 0.2.0 merge and added to
`collation_sensitive_fns`. **Recorded because of what it demonstrates:** the
collation guard's limitation #1 (it only sees listed functions) bit within days
of being written. Any new byte-producing function must be added to that list, and
the `AGENTS.md` contract now says so.


**#44 The gcdfo validation layer is inert.** Verified 2026-08-10 —
`notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-gcdfo-validation-layer-verification.md`. SHACL shapes
and example data bind their default prefix to `w3id.org/dfo/salmon#`, a namespace
with zero subjects, so `pyshacl` returns a vacuous pass over real gcdfo data; the
competency SPARQL has three queries in one `.rq` and each fails on an undeclared
prefix; and `robot-profile.yaml` replaces the default profile rather than
amending it, dropping 16 ERROR-level checks. Fix belongs in
`dfo-salmon-ontology`, not here.

**#48 Three error-severity `sdp.rules.yaml` rules are loaded and never executed.**
metasalmon is the workshop's designated final gate before DataONE deposit. Drive
the checks from the parsed rule `id`s so spec and implementation cannot silently
diverge. `R/schema-helpers.R`.

**#49 `validate_salmon_datapackage()` checks far less than it claims** — no
declared primary keys, no required-column nullability, no schema-required
metadata fields, and it reports success on corrupt SSSOM/decomposition artifacts
despite documenting itself as the end-to-end pre-flight.

### Open — P2 (correctness and conformance debt)

**#73 `.ms_redact_secrets()` misses qualified token names.** Verified:
`dataone_token=SECRET` redacts, `dataone_test_token=SECRET` and
`DATAONE_TEST_TOKEN=SECRET` do not. The alternation matches `dataone[_-]?token`
and needs the whole qualified name to match. **Both redactors have the gap** —
`.ms_redact_secrets()` (`R/cli-safety.R`) and the separate `.ms_knb_redact()`
(`R/knb-publication.R:1767`), which is the one handling KNB adapter errors and
warnings. Two implementations of one security contract is how the gap arose;
consider converging them. Captured HTTP
and provider errors are stored in returned tibbles and written to CSV, so this
is a leak at rest, not only on screen. **Blocking for the KNB staging work**,
which proposes exactly `dataone_test_token` as the staging credential — see
`notes/exec-plans/2026-08-11-knb-environments-and-workshop-rebuild.md` REVIEW 1.

**#53 `infer_column_role()` classifies 4-digit measurement columns as
`temporal`**, removing them from the entire semantic pipeline.
`R/dictionary-helpers.R:765`.

**#55 `apply_salmon_dictionary(strict = TRUE)` never errors on the common
coercion failures**, and the codes step silently `NA`s unlisted values.
`R/dictionary-helpers.R:1149`.

**#56 Semantic retrieval issues one serial `search_fn()` call per target** with no
deduplication of identical `(query, role, sources)` tuples.
`R/semantics-helpers.R:493`. Plus a cluster of smaller per-call costs listed in
the review (`term_search.R:341,1763,2190`, `semantic-suggestions.R:863,920`).

**#57 Assorted smaller correctness items** carried verbatim from the review:
locale-dependent DataONE plan fingerprint inputs now fixed under #40, but
`dwc_dp_build_descriptor(validate = TRUE)` still discards its validation result
and does not declare its Python toolchain in `SystemRequirements`; `llm_top_n`
cannot widen the shortlist on the direct `suggest_semantics()` path;
`find_terms()` does not check `parallel::mclapply` worker failure; ICES helpers
error instead of degrading on a missing column; the composite-intent gate's
`optional_hint_fields` is inert.

### Open — P3 (R-package and API hygiene)

**#58 No condition classes anywhere.** 415 `cli_abort` + 38 `cli_warn` + 3
`rlang::abort`, all unclassed, so callers cannot `tryCatch` selectively — a real
problem for a package meant to be driven from scripts and agents. Breaking-ish
for anyone matching on message text, so it wants a major bump.

**#59 Undocumented configuration and global-state mutation.** Nine
`metasalmon.*` options and fourteen environment variables with no registry, no
`.onLoad` defaults, and no help topic. `.search_bioportal()` permanently writes a
flag into the user's `options()`; `.ms_chat_new_session_id()` calls `sample()` and
advances the user's RNG stream. Both are CRAN-policy violations.

**#60 Example and API-surface gaps.** 22 of 30 documented topics wrap their entire
example in `\dontrun{}`, including examples that run offline in under a second,
so `R CMD check` validates almost no public example code; 15 of 45 exports ship no
examples. `NAMESPACE` blanket-imports the superseded `httr` while `httr2` is also
a hard Import. `DESCRIPTION` has a hand-written `Author:` naming someone absent
from `Authors@R`. No documented naming convention for the exported surface;
`semantic_suggestions` / `semantic_llm_assessments` are attributes with no
accessor.

### Open — P4 (ecosystem: spec, ontologies, workshop, governance)

**#61 Ecosystem findings.** 37 verified findings across `smn-data-pkg`,
`salmon-domain-ontology`, `dfo-salmon-ontology`,
`salmon-data-standards-workshop`, and cross-repo governance, plus 27
finder-only ontology findings that still need verification (#44 verified three of
them). These do not live in this repo and are tracked in
`notes/exec-plans/2026-08-10-comprehensive-ecosystem-review.md` §3–§7. The five
highest-leverage, in order: vocabulary-release pinning is impossible today
(which metasalmon's own KNB path requires); `datapackage.json` carries none of
SDP's semantic payload; the `smn:`/`gcdfo:` boundary is not machine-checkable;
no workshop episode is executable; and `smn-data-pkg` has no LICENSE, CI, or
Pages configuration.

## Code review of the implementation (2026-06-25)

A `/code-review` of Codex's implementation surfaced 10 findings (one confirmed
correctness bug + cleanup/test/altitude items). Resolved on this branch (full
suite green: 1281 pass / 0 fail):

- **Confirmed correctness (the bug #2 fix was only half-applied):** the no-gain
  exploration *skip* branch still returned a re-sorted shortlist paired with the
  original positional selected index. Fixed (returns the original record) +
  regression test. See item #2 above.
- **Dead context params:** removed the now-unused `context_files`/`context_text`
  from `.ms_prepare_context_chunks`, `.ms_llm_prepare_record`, and
  `.ms_llm_explore_record` (the pre-collected chunk pool is the sole input).
- **Silent column drop:** `.ms_semantic_discover_targets` now fails loud on any
  column outside the target-row contract instead of quietly subsetting it away.
- **DRY LLM arg surface:** the duplicate suggest-args identity helper was replaced
  by one canonical `.ms_llm_arg_names()` collected via `mget()` in
  `.ms_llm_review_plan()`, so the arg names live in exactly one place.
- **Batch fallback observability:** the per-key fallback *reasons* are now
  surfaced in the warning (not just the keys), and duplicate-key handling no
  longer clobbers a more specific first-occurrence reason.
- **`reject_shortlist` now has distinct behaviour:** a rejected shortlist that
  exploration cannot resolve escalates to `request_new_term`
  (`.ms_llm_escalate_unresolved_rejection`), surfacing the likely ontology gap;
  the distinct `llm_decision` is preserved through the batch/validator layers.
  Regression test added.
- **Tests + docs:** added dep-free four-scope (`target_sdp_file`) discovery
  coverage and a value-level LLM row-contract assertion; documented the
  intentional `inferred_*` return-slot naming and the deliberately divergent local
  `first_non_empty()` helper.

Deferred (unchanged): the open/deferred items in the snapshot above —
request-builder convergence (#31/#3), encoding detection (#6), create-time EDH XML
guard (#4), basename source disambiguation (#5), factor-scope `dataset_id` key
(#8), and real `AGENTS.md` content (#9).
